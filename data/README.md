# Sample Evidence

This folder contains placeholder Firefox browser artifacts used as sample evidence for the Browser Forensics Collection Tool.

These files are **empty example files** included to demonstrate the expected structure and file types that the tool collects, such as browser history (`places.sqlite`), cookies (`cookies.sqlite`), form history (`formhistory.sqlite`), and session data (`sessionstore.jsonlz4`).

They do **not** contain any real browsing data and are included only for demonstration purposes, as required by the project’s GitHub repository structure.
